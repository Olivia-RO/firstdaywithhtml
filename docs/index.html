    <h3>What are cats?</h3>
    <p>Cats are a carnivorous mammal belonging to the family of Felidae. The domestic cat, Felis catus, is hopefully the cats most often seen by humans on a regular basis. They were most likely domesticated around 4,000 years ago in Ancient Egypt.</p>
      <div class="funfact">
          <img src="images/mau-cat.jpg" class="funimg">
          <p class="funtext">Fun Fact! The Egyptian Mau Cat is thought to be the first domesticated cat. "Mau" is the word "cat" in Egyptian, and it’s speculated the name came from the meow of cats.</p>

  <div class="paragraph">
    <h3>Why did cats get domesticated?</h3>
    <p>Cats are natural at killing smaller animals, such as rodents. Ancient Egyptian cites most likely drew in a lot of rodents, and with them came cats. Seeing the potential of cats, (and most likely cooing at how adorable they are), Egyptians kept them around to keep the pests out.</p>
      <div class="funfact">
          <p class="funtext">Fun Fact! According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl8o9PsJPAQ">PBS Nature</a> the deadliest cat is the Black-footed cat; a cat that has males weighing at 4.2 lbs and females 2.9 lbs. They have a 60 percent hunting success rate, lions only have a 25 percent chance of having a successful kill.</p>

    <h3>What are cats doing now?</h3>
    <p>Nowadays, most cats in developed countries aren’t purchased for the thought of keeping rats and other pests out. While its certainly a benefit, most cat owners have cats to simply have a pet.</p>
<div class="funfact">
    <img src="images/dogncat.jpg" class="funimg">
    <p class="funtext">Fun Fact! It's a common belief that cats don’t have that familiar bond that most dogs do, and only tolerate humans for easy food and a safe home. While food and shelter are important, Kristyn Vital form Oregon State University <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zyNbdDgUb8">study shows</a> that most cats are as loyal as dogs.</p>

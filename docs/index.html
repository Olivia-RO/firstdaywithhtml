    <h3>What are cats?</h3>
    <p>Cats are a carnivorous mammal belonging to the family of Felidae. The domestic cat, Felis catus, is hopefully the cats most often seen by humans on a regular basis. They were most likely domesticated around 4,000 years ago in Ancient Egypt.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fun Fact! Its thought the cat domesticated by the Egyptians is a species called the Egyptian Mau Cat. "Mau" is the word "cat" in Egyptian, and it’s speculated the name came from the meow of cats.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why did cats get domesticated?</h3>
    <p>Cats are natural at killing smaller animals, such as rodents. Ancient Egyptian cites most likely drew in a lot of rodents, and with them came cats. Seeing the potential of cats, (and most likely cooing at how adorable they are), Egyptians kept them around to keep the pests out.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fun Fact! According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl8o9PsJPAQ">PBS Nature</a> the deadliest cat is the Black-footed cat; a cat that has males weighing at 4.2 lbs and females 2.9 lbs. They have a 60 percent hunting success rate, lions only have a 25 percent chance of having a successful kill.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What are cats doing now?</h3>
    <p>Nowadays, most cats in developed countries aren’t purchased for the thought of keeping rats and other pests out. While its certainly a benefit, most cat owners have cats to simply have a pet.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fun Fact! It's a common belief that cats don’t have that familiar bond that most dogs do, and only tolerate humans for easy food and a safe home. While food and shelter are important, Kristyn Vital form Oregon State University <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zyNbdDgUb8">study shows otherwise</a>.

    <h3>Should I get a cat?</h3>
    <p>This page was really only a brief explanation of cats. Cats, and any pets, are living creatures and shouldn’t be treated as inanimate objects. Research is a key part of owning pets; keep in mind your budget! If you get a pet cat, don't stress it out! That’s when cats feel threatened and will scratch and bite.</p>

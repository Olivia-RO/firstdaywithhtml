    <h3>What are hamsters?</h3>
    <p>Hamsters, scientific name Cricetinae, are an omnivorous rodent, however, most owners feed their hamsters a variety of fruits, vegetables, and herbs. They were successfully domesticated in 1939 in Syria and became pets in the United States around 1942.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
       Fun Fact! While there are 25 species of hamsters, only 5 are commonly kept as pets: the Syrian hamster, Dwarf Campbells Russian hamster, Dwarf Winter White hamster, the Roborovski hamster, and the Chinese hamster.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why did hamsters get domesticated?</h3>
    <p>The Syrian hamster was captured by Saul Alder in 1930 to have animal test subjects to help research a parasitic disease named Leishmaniasis. Hamsters became publicly available in the United States when Albert Marsh started his company, Gulf Hamstery.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fun Fact! Albert Marsh wrote a book called <a href="http://blog.modernmechanix.com/read-the-hamster-manual/#more" style="color: green">The Hamster Manual</a>, which spurred others into buying hamsters. Ironically, the book was a stepping stone for other breeders and companies, which sold more hamsters then Marsh and eventually lead to the closure of Gulf Hamstery in the 1950s.

    <h3>What are hamsters doing now?</h3>
    <p>Hamsters still play the role of test animals in labs, with, according to <a href="https://www.navs.org/what-we-do/keep-you-informed/science-corner/animals-used-in-research/hamsters-in-research/#.XnknMYhKhPZ" style="color: green">Navs</a>,80,593 hamsters were used in research, testing, teaching, or experimentation in 2018. However, most hamsters are kept as pets with 0.3 million in homes in 2019.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fun Fact! Hamsters can only bond with one or two humans after some trust bonding, starting off with letting the hamster smell your hands, letting them climb on your hands first, and being careful.

    <h3>What are the pros of owning hamsters?</h3>
    <p>While hamsters are a simpler pet than some, its still good to weigh pros and cons. Some pros are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They really are simple to look after with the right tools.</li>
      <li>Hamsters are generally clean pets, using one corner of the cage a toilet.</li>
      <li>Hamsters cost less to feed, with only needing to fill a hamster bowl once a day with pellets and giving the occasional fresh food.</li>
      <li>Hamsters do not require vaccinations, and only require a checkup at a minimum once a year.</li>
      <li>Little space is needed for a hamster, with a cage at minimum needing to be 24 inches by 12, with at least a hight of 12 inches as well.</li>
      <li>They have a life span of around 2 to 3 years.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3>What are the cons of owning hamsters?</h3>
  <p>Hamsters aren’t the perfect pet, and it’s needed to keep in mind the cons as well. Such as:<ul>
    <li>Hamsters are nocturnal and can be very loud at night.</li>
    <li>Hamsters will bite if threatened, and by having bad eyesight, its likely fast movements and not being able to smell you will lead to a bite.</li>
    <li>While not taking up much space, they still need to be active and require toys in their cage and new stimulation occasionally.</li>
    <li>Hamsters store their food, and it could be easy to overfeed a hamster, or having their food go "stale" by not eating it fast enough.</li>
    <li>Hamsters can be prone to parasites and infections if kept in an unclean environment.</li>
    <li>They have a life span of around 2 to 3 years.</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Should I get a hamster?</h3>
    <p>This page was really only a brief explanation of hamsters. Hamsters, and any pets, are living creatures and shouldn’t be treated as inanimate objects. Research is a key part of owning pets; keep in mind your budget! While hamsters are relatively easy, keep in mind they still can bite but still require love and attention.</p>

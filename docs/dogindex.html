    <h3>What are dogs?</h3>
      <p>Dogs are an omnivorous mammal belonging to the family Canidae. Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) were domesticated around 15,000 years ago by nomadic hunter-gathers. There is no specific place thought to domesticate dogs, but there’s evidence that the most plausible places are Central Asia, East Asia, and Western Europe.

   Fun Fact! The <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323239897_A_new_look_at_an_old_dog_Bonn-Oberkassel_reconsidered" style="color: mediumblue">Bonn-Oberkassel</a> dog was discovered in 1914 with two human skeletons dating back 14,500 years ago. Originally thought to be the mandible of a wolf, it was reexamined and reclassified as a domestic dog around 7 months of age buried with its owners.

    <h3>Why did dogs get domesticated?</h3>
    <p>Wolves are a powerful tool for hunting, and hunter-gathers needed all the help they could get. Feeding the wolves and breeding the nicer, more human-friendly wolves together gave way to the modern dog. Over time, once the need for food and shelter were relatively stable for humans, they focused on breeding certain aspects of dogs to create the 360 officially recognized dog breeds.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
          Fun Fact! The Saluki is speculated to be one of the oldest dog breeds, dating back 329 BC in Ancient Egypt. Supposedly, there are also carvings found in southern Iraq that looks like the Saluki, dating back to 7000 BC.
